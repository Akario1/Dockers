# What is this project?

simple docker project showing how to combine a "fullstack" project with container technology
using dockerfiles and docker compose 

# How do i run this?

if you already have docker the only thing you need to do is to cd into the project folder and type:
docker compose up --build

if you do not have docker, please install this first as this is only a showcase of docker not a production grade application
